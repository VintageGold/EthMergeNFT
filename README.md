# 9-13 Merge Contributor Git POAP
## Top
I ran with that the outline is a clock. There are 7 Ethereum logos in the POAP for 7 years of Ethereum. These logos are made up of 4 large ones and 3 small ones. The large ones being the second hand on the clock and the small ones being the hour hand on the clock. Both are at midnight symbolizing that the merge has been complete.  

## Middle
The pandas are climbing up the obstacles that the Ethereum community has overcome throughout the journey to proof of stake (POS). During the journey to POS the POW chain was 100% up when battle tested by Crypto Kitties, Defi Summer, and The NFT Boom volume. This is symbolized by the pandas climbing up the left side and the panda bear with a high sidekick is for kicking ass and handling all that workload. 

The pandas on the right side were working on the POS system during all these challenges.  The purple and colorful panda meet at the top as blah blah stated, the merge is more like a marriage than a goodbye and therefore the pandas meet in the middle like POW and POS forming a union.

### Top Right
The tree shaman on the right is for the person who is a got me into crypto being Ori Shimony who has been leading the charge on bringing DAOs to life with dOrg.

The pink and white sky symbolizes Algovera and all the data science DAO has granted me with projects and a warm and community.

Thank you,
